Got the Ardrino uno 
Ran through a couple of the basic examples to see how everything worked. 
Looking to get a flutter app up and running to get barcode scanning done. 
Using a camera is seeming more feasible. 
Just use a machine learning framework and train lots of photos. 
Can't be that hard right. 
I will be buying a camera today from microcenter and will be seeing how far I can get with sending the data to an API and processing those photos on the device.

Starting the iOS project for the Shelf Application.

Some things I know I need are:
Core Bluetooth
Combine
Core Data
Barcode Scanner

Getting the camera working:
Permissions:
Privacy - Camera Usage Description
*Not time to do this yet. 

I made a view that accepts an CGImage and displays a black camera if it is not in use.
Will change this soon.

What the heck is a singleton?
The goal of a singleton is to make sure that only on instance of a class is made.
We will be using that to make only one instance of the camera class.

Stopping here for the night. 
So far I am almost getting the permission for getting the camera access. 
Tomorrow I hope to have a camera up and running.
